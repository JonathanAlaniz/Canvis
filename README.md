# Canvis

Hello my name is Nuadi aka. Jonathan Alaniz. I created CANVIS to be an open source website template.
You'll find all the necessary functions to create PHP SESSIONS which will allow you to have your guests
turn into users. I always hated how there never seemed to be just a simple fullstack site that would 
allow us as developers to practice with and expand on. And so I set out to learn advanced server side programming
so that I could share that knowledge with my fellow coding amateurs. 

I hope you enjoy my code, and feel free to message me. Should be one of the most simple and straightforward
login systems available for free. Please follow and star my code, I would greatly appreciate
it.
