# Canvis

Hello my name is Nuadi aka. Jonathan Alaniz. I created CANVIS to be a very basic website template.
You can find an endless amount of tutorials on how to create simple navbars, forms, etc. But they
never seem to apply them into a functional site. Not just a static blog or image gallery, but a real site 
with the ability to create Users and display content for only those that are registered. 

I hope you enjoy my code, and feel free to message me. Should be one of the most simple and straightforward
login systems available for free. Please follow and star my code, I would greatly appreciate
it.
